Wonderful news to share! The ebook version of "Speaking Scripture: How to Memorize and Recite with Purpose and Delight" has been launched! You can now save a few bucks and carry this handy little book with you anywhere on your e-reading device or phone. This also means that those who need a larger print than the 14 point font in the physical book can now zoom in as much as they would like!

For aspiring authors, I would like to share that the ebook publishing process was EASIER than the physical book publishing process. I did not launch the versions together because I put off figuring out the ebook process thinking it would be much more complicated. Now I know! And now you know too.

God bless you as you continue to memorize God's Word. May you find delight in its pages. May God write the words and their living truth in your heart and mind. May the Holy Spirit continue to work in your life, and in the lives of those around you, through these precious words that are hidden there.

You can find the both versions of the book right here: [BOOK LINK](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRYN2HJB/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1NNJOQVO310WZ&keywords=speaking+scripture&qid=1673319222&sprefix=speaking+scriptur%2Caps%2C167&sr=8-1)

May God be glorified, and His Church edified!

Blessings,

Rachel E, Scripture Speaker.
