I was bustling around with life the other day and thinking about the topic of Scripture memory. (Surprise, surprise!) I'm starting to hear feedback for my book, "Speaking Scripture: How to Memorize and Recite with Purpose and Delight," and it is so encouraging to hear that people are getting excited to memorize where they thought they couldn't before. Praise God! As I was thinking about Scripture memory and the different reasons that can hold people back from it, a great mental image popped into my brain.

Exercise.

Scripture memory has been compared to exercise often, by greater people than I. It fits well because it really is a mental exercise, a great way to keep your brain healthy. But a new way to think of this image of exercise and Scripture memory had me itching to share it.

A lot of people will look at someone who memorizes a long list of books in the Bible and think, "Oh I could NEVER do that." Even one chapter seems intimidating. It's similar to the way I look at a muscular, 'ripped' individual as they lift fifty pounds over their heads. Oh readers, I definitely believe I could NEVER do that. But does that mean I should NEVER exercise?

No matter our abilities and ages we are all encouraged to exercise by all the health professionals. Maybe physical difficulties require you to exercise more slowly or carefully than the average person. It is the same way I want to encourage everyone to memorize Scripture. You may not be the person to memorize twenty books of the Bible (by the way I haven't even come close to that), but that does not mean that your spiritual life would not be benefitted by Scripture memory.

If you look at an Olympic runner blazing across the course and realize you will never be as fast as him, does that mean you should never take a walk around your neighborhood? You don't have to start with memorizing the book of Hebrews, you can start with memorizing a Psalm. Just like with exercise, the more we do it, the more we get better at it.

When I started to memorize Scripture, I stuck with just a chapter at a time. I memorized a couple of small books, but I didn't know how to review them well and chose to forget them. Eventually I memorized 1 John and have been able to keep it up and enjoy dwelling in its pages. This year, I finally felt ready after twelve years of Scripture memory exercise to take on Hebrews. I am so close to finishing. If you start now and keep at it, how much will your ability to memorize improve in twelve years?

The New Year is around the corner. Among your resolutions, would you consider including a resolution to "exercise" in Scripture memory? It's okay to start with the two-pound passage before you reach for the fifty-pounders. Wherever you start, I trust God will help you see great improvement as the year goes on.

God bless,
