Christmas time is rushing toward us and I find myself repeating the beautiful, familiar words of the Christmas story. December 4th I'll have the blessing of reciting this story to Grace Baptist Church in Redding, CA, and I'm working to freshen up my accuracy and internalization of the passages. Whenever I'm preparing for a recitation I have a special opportunity to see just how living and powerful Scripture really is (Hebrews 4:12). Even though I've had this set of passages memorized for about ten years, I am still learning more from them today. One word has especially stood out to me during this time of refreshment, and I would love to share with you just how special this word is.

"Mary."

Obviously, Mary is an important character in the Christmas story. But the use of her name touched me deeply in Luke 1:30, "Then the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.'"

The verses preceding 1:30 set the scene. The angel Gabriel has been sent on a special mission to share with Mary the news that she is the chosen one to fulfill prophecy and be the virgin who brings the Messiah into the world. The angel comes to Mary and declares, "Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!" (1:28). Rather than being joyful at this declaration, Mary is concerned. An angel is suddenly in her presence and declaring her blessed. She feels afraid and I would venture, rather confused. Later in the chapter she says that God has "regarded the lowly state of His maidservant (Luke 1:48)." She doesn't see herself as someone deserving of God's special blessing, what is this angel doing here, talking to her?

When the angel speaks to her again, he doesn't call her by the title "highly favored one." This time, he uses her _name._ There are no mistakes, Mary. There is no need to be afraid, Mary. God knows you. He has created you. He has prepared you. He has chosen you, _Mary._ God knows your name.

Do you ever store up all the truths of God being your personal creator and sovereign Lord and ponder them in your heart? (Luke 2:19). He knows your _name_. He knitted you together before you were born. All the days prepared for you are written in His book. (Psalm 139:15-16).

Meditating on this word, this name, in the passage has given me a sweet time of praising God for knowing each of us by name. He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant, me, and called me by name to serve Him and love Him all the days of my life and dwell in the house of the Lord forever, just as He has called _you_ by name.

You can pray for me as I prepare to recite this Christmas story once again. To internalize the words and truth, and be ready to share with it with passion. Thank you for your support in this ministry.

P.S. Book update: just waiting for the proof copies to arrive. As long as everything looks fine, "Speaking Scripture" will be published before the end of November, just in time for Christmas!
