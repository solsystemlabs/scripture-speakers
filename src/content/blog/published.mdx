Good morning and Merry Christmas to you!

I have some very exciting news: Speaking Scripture is published! It is now live on Amazon.com for you to order in time for Christmas, if you'd like to get some copies as gifts. I would definitely recommend it, as unashamedly biased as I am.

So, what is in this book? Wisdom gathered from 12 years of memorizing and reciting God's Word. The Lord has been working a good work in me for Scripture memorization and recitation for a long time, and I am so grateful for the ways in which He has trained me. From simple trial and error in my own personal walk, to a very helpful associates degree in communication, to leading groups at my local church for adult memorizers to recite as a ministry, I've been able to pick up a lot of know-how and encouragement to pass on to others. You CAN memorize Scripture, you CAN recite it to others powerfully, and I trust this book will help you do so effectively and to God's glory.

There are six full chapters on the topic of memorization and recitation and two mini chapters that include quick and intensely practical tips to memorize and recite. At the end of each chapter there is an infographic summation of the chapter before that will help cement the ideas for you. At the end of the book there is a great list of resources including other professional reciters, ministries that provide more resources for Scripture memorization, and a couple of my favorite books to recommend for memorizing or reciting Scripture. The book is printed in 14 point font at the request of some of my favorite older saints.

This book is a quick read and written to be very down-to-earth, approachable, and unintimidating. You don't have to be afraid to pick up this book if you are one of the more reluctant memorizers. And, it should hold some encouragement for even the more proficient memorizers and reciters.

You can get a copy on Amazon.com, or, if you would like to order in bulk for your Bible study or ministry, contact me at scripturespeakers@gmail.com and I can ship directly to you at a greatly discounted rate.

Oh, brothers and sisters in Christ, I am SO excited to share this book with you.

May God be glorified and His church edified!

Rachel Eernisse, Scripture Speaker
