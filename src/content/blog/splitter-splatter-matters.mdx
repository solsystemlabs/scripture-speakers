I am very slowly preparing to re-memorize the book of Philippians. I first memorized this precious book as a challenge for my youth group, and after switching my preferred translation of the Bible, I let this book slip from my heart's library. It has been years since my good ole youth group days and my familiarity with the book's concepts has remained, but the exact wording has faded enough that I can finally start the re-memorization process!

Word to the wise, before you start memorizing a large heart's library of Scripture, make sure you are confident in your translation choice. It is very difficult to switch a passage from one translation to another because the wording will be so similar and yet distinct. It's something I address in my book, ["Speaking Scripture: How to Memorize and Recite with Purpose and Delight."](https://a.co/d/hJANZJT) If you need some more encouragement and advice, I'd encourage you to get a copy.

In any case, I've been reading through Philippians and meditating there. In Philippians chapter 2, this verse and the surrounding context resonated with me:

"Yes, and if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all." Philippians 2:17.

Paul is referring to what could be his coming execution, although I also think some of that pouring is being done beforehand as he sits under house arrest with a jailer chained to his side. That's the situation he was in when he penned these words!

I feel sympathetic to Paul because I can often feel like I'm being poured out to serve my family. I also recognize that lies start to come into my head that say it's just me, or it's just mothers, that experience this kind of service. I start to complain in my head about the thankless tasks that face us. But Paul writes about his experience without bemoaning it, instead, he rejoices in it! Ultimately, he is able to rejoice in his situation because he is looking to Christ as his example, and he urges us to do the same.

All of this musing led to the following poem, which is my motherly reflection on Philippians 2. If you are blessed by this poem, you may like to look up my book of poetry which includes fifty more poems inspired by Scriptures [here.](https://a.co/d/28UXswS)

Hang in there, moms. Let us press on and look to Christ, let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus!

**Splitter Splatter Matters**  
_By Rachel Eernisse_

I'm being poured out  
With a splitter  
And splatter  
And a drip, drip, drip.  
I bend to wipe messes  
With a daughter on my hip.  
The whining starts raging  
And I bring the calm.  
The storm surrounds me  
Of a messy home.  
It feels demeaning,  
The demanding,  
The moaning.  
I give and I give  
With little thanks.  
How empty is  
My Mama-love-tank.

Am I the only one?  
Ah, no, there are others.  
It must be just us,  
The faithful, tired mothers.

Still it's a lie,  
We aren't the only ones poured.  
Paul says he's a drink offering  
For the Lord.  
He says he rejoices  
To be poured out  
For the faith of his brethren  
Who need him now.

Paul knew what it's like,  
Someone's attached to your hip.  
Going potty alone  
Is a rare trip.  
They are constantly there,  
And Paul is stuck at home.  
His talents and strengths  
Restrained, alone.  
He joyfully submits  
To the Lord's plan.  
He doesn't feel demeaned  
And he doesn't wish to demand.  
He looks to Another  
Who was also poured,  
And we as mothers  
Can also look to the Lord.

Wasn't Jesus followed  
When He wanted a moment alone?  
And talk about demeaning,  
Leaving the Royal Throne  
To walk in the dust  
And the dirt  
And the grime.  
To feel the pressure  
Of everyone's demands  
On His time.  
He gave Himself freely  
Every moment,  
Every day.  
He paused to heal  
And wipe tears away.  
He continued without proper thanks,  
Knowing He would be betrayed.

Let this mind be in you,  
Those being poured,  
The same humble mind  
Of Jesus Christ our Lord.

We aren't alone.  
We aren't the only ones to face  
The trials and struggles  
Of the constant pace  
Of demands  
That splash out  
A little more of ourselves.  
Jesus, our Savior, did as well.

The little brethren in our house  
See Christ when we're poured out.  
So rejoice in the splatter,  
What you do matters.
