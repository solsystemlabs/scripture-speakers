I stifled a whimper as I shifted in my bed. The sheets, which normally felt so soft against my skin, were scraping against me like sandpaper. There was a red rash spreading from face and neck down and across my whole body. I was thankful it wasn't itching, but it made my skin so tender to the touch! I was so tired, but the prednisone I had been prescribed was making it difficult to sleep. Mono had knocked me down. Do you know what I didn't do in this moment?

I did NOT start reviewing the book of Hebrews in my mind.

Scripture memory has been a precious part of my walk with Christ for many years, and I did, indeed, memorize the whole book of Hebrews last year. When I find it difficult to sleep, I often do review this thick, lovely book of the Bible in my mind. But in this moment, when I was tempted to dwell on misery and so overcome with fatigue, I did _not_ have the mental fortitude necessary to focus on the words of this high theological treatise. Instead, I drank from a simple Psalm just like the tired little sheep I was. Over and over again the sweet words soothed my soul.

_The Lord is my shepherd;  
I shall not want.  
He makes me to lie down in green pastures;  
He leads me beside the still waters.  
He restores my soul;  
He leads me in the paths of righteousness  
For His name’s sake._

_Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  
I will fear no evil;  
For You are with me;  
Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me._

_You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;  
You anoint my head with oil;  
My cup runs over.  
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me  
All the days of my life;  
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord  
Forever._

I felt peace as I breathed in and out, resting in the presence of my Shepherd. He was taking care of His sick sheep just as He always has. I hadn't been healed yet, and it would have been nice if my mono rash had not been so severe. But He was with me. He was leading me to rest just like the word picture David used in his Psalm, of the Shepherd bringing him to green pastures to restore his soul. I only memorized this Psalm in order to help my daughters start their own memory journeys, but oh, I was so thankful to have it in my heart for that moment! Six simple, sweet verses were there for the Holy Spirit to remind me of them just when I needed them most.

**Bible Book Method: The Only Way?**

So often I meet new memorizers of Scripture who have been inspired by other people memorizing whole books of the Bible. As they seek to get started with memorizing Scripture for themselves, they seem to think that memorizing whole books of the Bible is the only way to do it. Somehow, memorizing just a chapter, just a simple Psalm, or just a few verses "isn't as good" or as "holy" as taking in a whole book. But oh, dear brothers and sisters in Christ, this simply isn't true. The Bible tells us that:

_"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work (2 Timothy:3:16-17)."_

"All" means every single piece of Scripture is beneficial for the Christian life. Even the little verses are ready to be used by the Holy Spirit to instruct you and equip you. Any time you are spending memorizing God's Word, in pieces or whole chunks, is valuable. And, there is something more to consider.

**A Bible Buffet**

The Bible is a rich buffet for our spiritual nourishment. Peter wrote to the believers who had been scattered through persecution to lay ". . .aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking," and instead, "as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, if indeed you have tasted that the Lord _is_ gracious." Just like a baby needs nourishment, we need to partake of the Bible to be spiritually nourished. But is milk the only thing on the menu?

Paul wrote to the Corinthian church despairing that they were only drinking "milk" when it came to the Bible. He says in verses 1 through 3:

_"And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ. I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able to receive it, and even now you are still not able; for you are still carnal."_

Paul is frustrated that the Corinthian church has not been growing spiritually, and because they have not been growing, they are not ready for the more difficult concepts the Bible teaches. It's a bit too much "food for thought" for them.

The author of Hebrews has a similar rebuke for his readers. In Hebrews 5:12 we read:

_"For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food."_

There are at least two types of food on our buffet table now. We have milk and solid food. Young Christians or spiritually immature Christians need milk, the more foundational teachings necessary to understand other spiritual concepts. More mature Christians need solid food, seeking to study and learn more from their Bibles. But we can also see that sometimes those needs shift, for the mature Christians referenced in Hebrews 5:12 have reverted back to needing milk for a time.

Perhaps that shifting can happen more often, just as our bodies needs will change from day to day. I may be ready for steak in the book of Hebrews next week, (I still have mono while writing this), but last week I was only able to sip the "pure milk" of the Word. At the moment, I've been able to meditate in a few longer passages as my strength starts to return. I've been enjoying the "chicken soup" of the book of Jonah! I have been so blessed to have ready such a variety of passages to meditate in as my spiritual needs fluctuate.

**A Colorful, Varied Diet**

It's important for new memorizers and experienced memorizers alike to have a colorful and varied diet when it comes to their Scripture memory. The beauty of Scripture memory is that Scripture will be available to us in every needy moment, but we can't always predict what those needs will be. We might be tempted to only memorize the big, tough passages to challenge ourselves, but we also need some sweet bottles of milk on hand for easy spiritual nourishment.

In fact, if we take the metaphor of the Bible buffet further, it might be a good idea to purposefully take a break after eating up a delicious steak in memorizing a whole book. Let's wash it down with a time of memorizing lighter, easier passages. This helps us avoid burnout and give our hearts time to absorb the heavy spiritual meal we've already taken in.

**A Tasty Conclusion**

As you continue to build up the Scripture memory library of your heart, I encourage you to approach it like a wonderful buffet of options that are designed to meet your spiritual needs of nourishment. Come to the Bible buffet and enjoy that thick steak and potatoes of memorizing a whole book. Drink in a glass of cold milk of the sweetest Psalms. Sample some of the tasty vegetables available by memorizing just one chapter. Be sure to include some vitamins of individual verses that you can use for a specific, quick moment of need. As you memorize Scripture and enjoy the Bible buffet, you are setting aside nourishment that will benefit you later when you need it most. Next time you need something to chew on, drink deeply, or feebly sip from God's Word, you will be ready!
