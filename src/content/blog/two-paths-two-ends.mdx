You never know how God might use memorized Scripture in your life. A lot of the Scriptures I memorized have inspired me to write poetry to meditate in them more deeply. You can read a whole volume of this poetry in my little book, "Delight: Meditating in the Scriptures with Poetry." Today, I would love to share one of the poems with you inspired by Psalm one.

Two Paths, Two Ends  
by Rachel Eernisse

Blessed is the man  
Who does not walk  
In the wisdom of the world.  
He does not stand  
In sinner's path,  
His boundaries have not blurred.  
He does not sit  
In scoffer's seat,  
To speak the scoffer's words.  
  
But his delight  
Is the law of God.  
His joy is to meditate  
Day and night  
Within His laws,  
Where he will find His grace.  
Like a tree  
That's firmly planted  
By rivers flowing wide,  
He bears the fruit  
Of the Spirit's work,  
And his branches always thrive.  
  
Not so the man  
Who chose to walk  
In the ungodly way.  
By his choice  
He fell in sin  
And ungodly he became.  
Useless, fruitless,  
Blown away,  
The chaff that holds the grain.  
The wicked man  
Will live his life  
With this same sad refrain.  
  
When all will end,  
When time is done,  
When God in judgment stands,  
God will bless  
Just like in life,  
The holy, righteous man.  
But sinners cannot  
Stand within  
The righteous congregation  
God will justly  
Give to them  
The proper condemnation.  
  
What was the choice  
That separates  
The living trees and chaff?  
One was planted  
In the Word,  
The other evil's path.
