These days you can find me muttering around the house as I prepare to recite the book of Hebrews next month and also memorize a new chapter to meet a local church's request this month. It's a lot to keep up with, and I need a lot of time vocalizing these passages to be ready to speak them. By the end of the day, you won't hear me muttering anymore. Instead, there is an unusual silence from me, punctuated by whispered necessary communications. My throat is becoming sore from its constant work! But I still need to be dwelling in these passages, so what am I to do? Thankfully, I recently found a new method of visual memorization that is not only helping me do okay despite a sore throat but is also improving my Scripture memory work overall.

This method was inspired by Josh Summers over at BibleMemoryGoal.com. He uses something called a "memory palace" to organize his memorized Scriptures in his mind. He visualizes a familiar building and "places" memorized Scriptures and references onto the different familiar items in the building. He talked through this method in episode twelve of Scripture Memory Fellowship's podcast, which you can listen to here: [https://scripturememory.com/verselocker/podcast](https://scripturememory.com/verselocker/podcast).

In this episode, he says that our brains are designed to memorize things spatially, to memorize information with a physical context. That's why a memory palace can be so effective. Although I wasn't ready to build a memory palace in the way he described, the idea of memorizing Scripture with the help of a physical context really stuck with me, and I found a new way to apply that idea with some colored pencils. Thankfully, it does not require any use of my voice!

To review completed passages like the book of Hebrews, I started by drawing a large, empty number for the chapter I was working with. Then I sketched out lightly a visual representation of the text inside the shape of the number, reciting the verses in my head as I went along (out loud is always more effective, but I was saving my voice!). When I filled the number and finished the chapter I went back over the drawing and recited again using the drawing as my only prompt. I added a few details where I needed a little more help remembering the right words, and then I colored in each picture while reciting the verses in my head again. I changed the color of the background for each time I felt a shift in the conversation of the passage, like the change from one concept to another. I didn't draw a rebus that would represent every word, just a picture to help me remember each verse or concept. I found in chapter nine I needed to draw more detail for each time it said a combination of "calves, goats, bulls," because I kept mixing up which combination was used when.

To my great joy, this method of drawing out a memorized passage has greatly solidified my Scripture memory work. I used to get confused between chapter nine and ten when Jesus is introduced as the new Mediator of the new covenant in a different way for each chapter and leading into a different conversation following. I feel much more grounded in the memorized information and can keep track of the flow of the text with more ease.

I happily drew out Colossians 3 to test out this method as a way to initially memorize a passage, and I have been thrilled with the resulting success. I drew much more detail this time since every verse is new to me. Despite not using my voice nearly as much as I usually do when working on new passages, I'm able to recite, a bit falteringly, the entire chapter after just a couple hours of work. I pull out the drawing whenever I'm ready to work on the chapter and recite through it while looking at the pictures. Usually, I don't ever need to reference the written text!

I hope that by sharing my new drawing method you've been inspired to try something new with your own Scripture memory work. Finding a way to use your brain's tendency to store information spatially could be a game-changer for you, too!

Now, if you need me, you can probably find me back at the drawing board. Bring snacks.
