Quite by accident, I stumbled across Janet Pope and her speaking ministry as a perfect answer to prayer. I was at a point in the ministry of Scripture Speakers that I needed some specific encouragement and wisdom, and Janet was willing to offer this freely. Despite being a busy author and speaker, Janet was glad to talk with me. She has continued to be a tremendous blessing to my life and ministry ever since.

If you have not yet been blessed by the words of Janet Pope, then you are in for a special treat. Janet is the author of "His Word in My Heart: Memorizing Scripture for a Closer Walk with God." This uplifting book has inspired many people to memorize Bible passages to know God more intimately. It is beautifully written and I highly recommend you read it! Today, you will also get to read some words of encouragement from Janet-- a sweet little message she has shared with us here at Scripture Speakers. Janet has memorized over 20 books of the Bible! The question is, WHY?

**Why I Memorize the Bible**  
_by Janet Pope_

Thousands of people around the world devote themselves to memorize the Bible. Who might that  
include, you wonder. A soon-to-be prisoner in a communist cell? A clandestine missionary in hostile territory? A social recluse, with musty curtains drawn and hours unscheduled? Surely not the savvy, equipped with a Bible App.

We memorize the Bible for the same reason others store away lines from poems and songs, movies  
and speeches. Shakespeare devotees still thrive in the 21 st century. We borrow the beauty and strength found in someone else’s words, and take ownership –mantras we wish we could have said. We walk with Robert Frost in The Road Not Taken. We taste the bitterness of another in, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Patriotism wells up as we pledge allegiance to the flag. Beach Boys’ lyrics take us back to a carefree place and time. Memorized lines connect us to those who penned them. They take abstract longings and give them a stage. Words wound. And heal. For better or worse, whether true or false, what we memorize becomes part of us.

I memorize the Bible likewise. The Book of Books connects me to the Author of all. His Word rescues me from my world and ushers me into his. As he unveils his thoughts and unfolds his plan, I embrace him for who he is, and slowly let go of who I want him to be. In time, my watered soil responds to the One who loved me first. I recite aloud the Sermon on the Mount and with each line conviction builds. I choose the narrow road and reject the one that glitters. Living words linger in my mind and filter out the chatter.

When goblins swallow me up, and phantoms rob my sleep, I run to Psalm 27. Light dispels the darkness and calms my fluttered heart. The words of David become my words of worship, as I repeat them back to God.

Why do many people memorize the Bible? Because it takes us where we cannot go ourselves— to  
pinnacles of joy, and depths of knowing God. To truth revealed, and mysteries concealed. We invite others to join us in our pursuit of knowing and loving God more. Any takers?
